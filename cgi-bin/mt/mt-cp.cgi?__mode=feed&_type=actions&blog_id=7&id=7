            <![CDATA[<p>Awesome photo! It is wonderful because you can read all sorts of things into it, like: how does this illuminate the relationship between my mother and her much-younger sister? Was the original intent for this to be just a photo of my mom and Virginia decided to grab the spotlight for herself? And the basic differences in their demeanor are clear, my mom with her cheesecakey pose and pointed toe, Ginny more gregarious and tomboyish. This looks like the backyard of the house on Ohio Street in Corpus.</p>]]>

<p>This is a little torso she sculpted in clay.  Isn't it amazing?  When I found it, I confess it kind of took me by surprise, I wouldn't have thought of her doing something so intimate.  It is really a sensitive and accurate depiction of the female form.  It is really lovely.</p>]]>

            <![CDATA[<p>My mom was a huge fan of William Steig, and I grew up surrounded by more of this type of book than regular childrens books.  For those I had to go over to my grandmother's house.  The books I found in my box are the kind of books I remember spending hours examining in minute detail. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/47582661@N00/3072609722/" title="book1 by *jenny b allsorts, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3198/3072609722_aa1f8012c7_o.jpg" width="500" height="530" alt="book1" /></a></p>

<p>The green one I remember especially, not because of the anti-technology moral of the thing but mainly because of the art!  Incredibly graphic and detailed line work throughout every page.  Here are just a couple to give you the idea.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/47582661@N00/3071773255/" title="book2 by *jenny b allsorts, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3145/3071773255_7f7bfcaf3f_o.jpg" width="500" height="321" alt="book2" /></a></p>

<p>Can you tell what the last one is depicting? It is the island of Manhattan, before they decided to take down all the buildings and let it go back to being nature.  Fabulous.</p>]]>

My mom saved soooo many clippings from the newspaper, not just of people she knew, but any article or photo that interested her. I would guess that probably 20% of what I've found in the boxes was newspaper clippings.

            <![CDATA[<p>It is probably becoming very clear that my mom loved to save every scrap of memorabilia from her life. It is no surprise that she was in her heyday when letter-writing was much more commonplace than it is now. My box contains packet after packet of letters like this one. And this one...</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/47582661@N00/3054293857/" title="letters3 by *jenny b allsorts, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3060/3054293857_a4159f6420_o.jpg" width="500" height="362" alt="letters3" /></a></p>

<p>The interesting thing is how mundane and kind of boring these letters are. I thought I would get drawn into them, and not be able to stop reading, but it was typical for them to be like a phone conversation is nowadays, what you've been up to, the trivial things that occupy your days, who stopped by, etc. But I am envious of those days. I can't remember the last time I wrote an actual letter. It is all email and phone conversations that leave little or not tangible trace. There is something so satisfying about a bundle of letters tied up with a string. Its kind of a shame that practice is passing.</p>]]>

Its probably Aunt Lucille's or Betty Bliss'. 1952 is the year I was born, and I have visited with the Bliss and Nelson boys as they grew up. The Wheelers I don't know, I don't think they are relatives of mine. I know Tarry and Brian especially well, we visited them in Santa Barbara many times when I was growing up, as my mom and their dad Richie were very close. Tarry was a groomsman at our wedding (I think... I know he was there) and I still keep in touch with him via email. He and his wife run a mission somewhere over in Africa.</p>]]>
