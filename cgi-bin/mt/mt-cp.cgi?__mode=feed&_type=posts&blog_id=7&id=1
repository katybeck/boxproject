<p>Anyways, I can remember you and Gramma talking about the PEO when I was in high school. You would never tell me what it was, but you would drop lots of intriguing hints. It was really annoying. :)</p>]]>

<p>Its a fascinating document, filled with stories and pictures and brochures from her trip there. I'm guessing that wasn't supposed to be the assignment, though, because her teacher has written "Did you understand the assignment?" on the back:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/katy/3038252628/" title="Box Project, Initial Photos by katybeck, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3002/3038252628_7367bd659c.jpg" width="375" height="500" alt="Box Project, Initial Photos" /></a></p>

<p>My assumption is that she didn't like the assignment as given and did exactly what she wanted. Sounds like a few other people I know. :)</p>]]>
