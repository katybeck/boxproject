        <title>I can&apos;t remember any good stories off the top of my head, only that Delta Gamma symbol was the anchor. Oh, and a song she used to sing just occurred to me:

&quot;Oh I&apos;m a DG, a dirty little DG,
I leave a trail of blood where ere I go...
I&apos;m a dirty splotch, on the family Scotch,
and I eat (slurp) raw (slurp) meat (slurp slurp)!&quot;

It goes without saying that I always thought that was a little weird.

She kept her mailing address current with them. They sent a postcard recently asking for her info for the next directory and I had to call and tell them she had died. It was kind of sad.</title>

        <title>There was a whole box but they were mostly just plain balls, or plastic bells. This was the one with the most character. The box itself was pretty neat! I should photograph it.</title>

        <title>Based on the number I&apos;ve seen in all the boxes so far, she saved every greeting card she (and I) ever received. I didn&apos;t look in many of them, but I do recognize the senders, mostly they were from relatives or family friends. I sort of remember she had me send lots of cards out, too, so I guess that&apos;s why I got a lot in return. </title>

        <title>Unfortunately I don&apos;t know where they came from. She collected them in her early days I think. They were kept at my grandmother&apos;s house like maybe they were from her teen and high school days, or maybe college. I was imagining that servicemen would buy them overseas and bring them back as gifts, but that is only a guess. Virginia might know.</title>

        <title>This was one of the boxes in her &quot;storage unit,&quot; which was really just a big closet off of the hall at her retirement community. Based on the markings on the boxes, it appears that some were packed up in Corpus Christi and moved unopened to Pittsburgh, San Diego and then to Dallas in Fall of 2002.</title>

        <title>How interesting, I need to go back and read some and imagine her speaking the lines. So would you say they were good puns or awful ones? Do you find her humor funny, or is it more composed for the letter recipient in particular?</title>
