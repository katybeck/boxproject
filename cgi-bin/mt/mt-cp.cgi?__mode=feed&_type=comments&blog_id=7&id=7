        <title>Hehe, yes I remember. I think I made it in Sunday School. Does it have a hook on the back? I have a vague memory that it hung on the wall at my grandmother&apos;s house.</title>

        <title>There she is! I love the fashion for posing for photos back then, very hollywood starlet-ish with the dramatic lighting and gazing pensively off to the side. She was such a social person, always the belle of the ball!</title>

        <title>Gosh, I have no knowledge of this musical piece. She played piano and sang on several choruses, so maybe she performed this with one of those groups. Or maybe played ukalele! We found one with &quot;Doroth&quot; painted on it, no clue why there is no &quot;y&quot;.</title>

        <title>This was my class picture from maybe freshman or sophomore year. This was when I was enrolled with some friends in modeling school which they called &quot;charm school&quot; for some reason. This was the trendy haircut of the day, we were going for a &quot;Twiggy&quot; look because I was so skinny and had big eyes. We modeled groovy outfits for the local trendy dress shop at several venues. Somewhere are some pictures from my professional photoshoot, and one I really like that was taken at a fashion show and I think appeared in the paper.</title>

        <title>Love this! I don&apos;t think that is my grandmothers handwriting. Its probably Aunt Lucille&apos;s or Betty Bliss&apos;. 1952 is the year I was born, and I have visited with the Bliss and Nelson boys as they grew up. The Wheelers I don&apos;t know, I don&apos;t think they are relatives of mine. I know Tarry and Brian especially well, we visited them in Santa Barbara many times when I was growing up, as my mom and their dad Richie were very close. Tarry was a groomsman at our wedding (I think... I know he was there) and I still keep in touch with him via email. He and his wife run a mission somewhere over in Africa.</title>

        <title>Wow, Virginia doesn&apos;t look much different than she does nowadays. Maybe the glasses are a tad retro, she got contacts a long time ago. I remember when she got them, it was a big deal because they had just come out. My mom saved soooo many clippings from the newspaper, not just of people she knew, but any article or photo that interested her. I would guess that probably 20% of what I&apos;ve found in the boxes was newspaper clippings. She saved multiple issues about historical events, like MLK and both Kennedys&apos; assassinations, the moon walk, 9/11.</title>

        <title>Family names are so funny. You call these two Gramma and Mildred, I call them Gramma and Mother. It seems so weird to think of my Gramma as Mildred since I never heard anyone use that name for her. Most people usually referred to my grandparents as &quot;Ed and Mil&quot;. Love the shoulder pads!</title>

        <title>This was one of the boxes in her &quot;storage unit,&quot; which was really just a big closet off of the hall at her retirement community. Based on the markings on the boxes, it appears that some were packed up in Corpus Christi and moved unopened to Pittsburgh, San Diego and then to Dallas in Fall of 2002.</title>

        <title>Awesome photo! It is wonderful because you can read all sorts of things into it, like: how does this illuminate the relationship between my mother and her much-younger sister? Was the original intent for this to be just a photo of my mom and Virginia decided to grab the spotlight for herself? And the basic differences in their demeanor are clear, my mom with her cheesecakey pose and pointed toe, Ginny more gregarious and tomboyish. This looks like the backyard of the house on Ohio Street in Corpus.</title>

        <title>It does look like the same era as his Navy photos, but I think he had been discharged by then. My folks got married in 1950 or 1951, so I&apos;m guessing here, but the items on the ledge behind him look like just-opened wedding gifts to me.</title>
