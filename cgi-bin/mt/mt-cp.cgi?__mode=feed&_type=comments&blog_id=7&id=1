        <title>I try to do this when the weather is good. Its amazing how much calmer and less distracted I am in class when I&apos;ve walked a little over a mile to get there. I barely need coffee!</title>

        <title>I like the Contigo mug that&apos;s sold at Target right now. The lip flips up to drink but is water-tight when closed, and can be screwed on in two positions to work for either left or right-handed caffeination. AND the base of the handle has a caribeaner hinge so you can clip it to your backpack.</title>

        <title>I do this in my apartment year-round, using a fold-up clothes rack from IKEA. It folds flat so I can store it behind a shelf, but when  fully opened I can dry two loads of laundry at once! Its great in the winter to set it up in front of the radiators..</title>

        <title>I like the sunny corner of these photos. Was this box in Gramma&apos;s storage unit, or at our house? Also, remind me what year Gramma moved from California to Dallas. :)</title>

        <title>The letters in my box are similar. The funny thing for me is that I can hear Gramma&apos;s verbal mannerisms in all of them, particularly all the puns. They are constant and numerous, in every line of every letter I read, and it makes me wonder how much of that came through to the people reading her letters.</title>
