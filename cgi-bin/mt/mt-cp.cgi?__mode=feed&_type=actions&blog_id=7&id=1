            <![CDATA[<p>Songs of Experience is a poster series addressing the fall from grace of American cultural institutions such as Uncle Sam, Hollywood, and baseball. The challenge was to produce a poster series inspired by events that occurred on September 13 in any year, and the process was my first foray into pulling a coherent narrative from a seemingly endless and unrelated archive of the daily news. </p>

<p>Lines from the Star Spangled Banner (written September 13, 1814) were used as an ironic counterpoint to the rise and fall of cultural icons like Uncle Sam (born September 13, 1776, as legend has it), Hollywood, and Major League Baseball.</p>

<div>
<img src="/project-images/songs-of-experience-unclesam.jpg" /><p>The first stanza of the Star Spangled Banner &mdash; "Oh say can you see?" &mdash; is juxtaposed with images of spying and surveillance.</p>
</div>

<div>
<img src="/project-images/songs-of-experience-hollywood-hands.jpg" /><p>"What so proudly we hailed" is paired with celebrity mugshots such as Frank Sinatra and Hugh Grant.</p>
</div>

<div>

<p>"Through the perilous fight" is a silhouette of Babe Ruth swinging an enormous syringe.</p>

            <![CDATA[<p>In thinking about the ways that the shift from physical to digital has impacted the archive, I investigated the nature of film photography &mdash; learning as much as I could about the craft and process involved in this obsolete art form. The following images are from a series taken during the winter on Cliff Walk in Newport, RI.</p>

<p>A lot of my photography considers the impact of human building and human dwelling on the natural world.</p>

            <![CDATA[<p>Small Steps is a poster series advocating for small lifestyle changes that conserve resources, energy, or just create more responsible consumers. Each poster is intended to be hung in a high traffic urban area, and consists of a full sheet of stickers. Each time a commuter has done the action promoted on the poster, they are invited to take a sticker. What is revealed as stickers are taken away becomes an analog visualization of the carbon emissions conserved by the community that day.</p>

            <![CDATA[<p>In the front of my thesis book, there is a signature page with the following words:</p>

<p>"Presented in Partial Fulfillment of the Requirements for the Degree of Master  of Fine Arts in Graphic Design in the Department of Graphic Design of the Rhode Island School of Design."</p>

<p>In other words, this thesis book alone is not enough for a degree at this school. It turns out that the three forms I've been exploring in terms of convergence &mdash; web sites, designed objects, and physical experience &mdash; are the same elements that must come together to form a complete masters thesis at RISD.</p>

<p>Using my body of work as the archive, In Partial Fulfillment considers this book, my website, and my thesis defense as three distinct and dependent ways of navigating through my thesis. In order to see the whole, you need to experience its parts.</p>

<p>My goal was to have these three components relate to each other without being completely redundant, to show different lenses onto the same body of work, and to tangibly demonstrate the multiplicity of the work I produced in my three years here.</p>

<blockquote>
<strong>the web site</strong>

<p>I could have made an entire thesis about the relationship between books and web sites.  It is just one small portion of design's relationship to technology, and in planning my own website I wanted to build in complementary indexes to my body of work. The web site, the most intangible of the final thesis forms, contains indexes to the most concrete: a rigid taxonomy consisting of the semester in which the work was produced, and the media it utilized.</p>

<p><strong>the presentation</strong></p>

<p>The thesis defense lies somewhere in between books and websites: presenting the thesis as one linear narrative, but using the organizational structure of the books (described on the following page) as a guide.</p>

<p>The presentation included a series of posters designed specifically for the defense, combining the punched hole mapping from the books with quotes that highlight my interest in each subject.</p>

<p><strong>the book</strong></p>

<p>If the most intangible thesis document is organized by concrete details, then the most concrete of the thesis forms is organized by the most abstract. My thesis book -- or books -- are organized around the key terms I use when analyzing my work. Each term is contained in its own book readers can investigate the multiplicity of relationships between these six ideas in their own way.</blockquote></p>

            <![CDATA[<p>A collaboration with Lauren Francesconi, this poster series on the subject of Bernd & Hilla Becher grew out of our fascination with pairs. These two photographers worked as a unit for their entire professional lives, producing thousands of finely crafted photographic typologies over the course of 40 years. We sought to produce a pair of posters that addressed each member of the pair individually as well as collectively.</p>

<p>Together the posters address the relationship between the individual and the collective, and between art and the the notion of the archive.</p>

<div>
<img src="/project-images/becher-tangled.jpg" />
<p>The posters are four inches high and twenty feet long each, but are connected only at one end. The Bernd side of the set contains information about the conceptual motivation for their work &mdash; the need to archive architectural evidence of the early Industrial Revolution in Europe &mdash; and data on every gallery show the two did.<br /><br />The Hilla side is devoted to the fine craft of black and white photography, which was her contribution to the couple's work, and contains every typology they ever produced.</p>

            <![CDATA[<p>If an archive is a collection of elements, what happens to the elements that don't make the cut? The Outsider Zine was built off of the idea that while most everyone has at one point felt like an outsider, powerful forms of group identity often rise up around common feelings of alienation. Insiders become outsiders, and outsiders become insiders, depending on how you look at it.</p>

<p>In a collaborative effort with Jen Magathan, Mary Banas, and Cameron Neat, we created a zine that played with the false dialectic of the insider and the outsider. We surveyed 20 members of the course Elective Affinities, prompting them to finish the following sentence: "I feel like an outsider because ______."</p>

<p>With the results of the survey, we generated a poster that unified the various reasons for feeling like an outsider, and a series of t-shirts with one survey response printed on each front. The zine contained a pastiche of both images and text, exploring some common forms of outsider culture and the subcultures that have sprung up around them.</p>

<p>The final form of the project was a limited edition of 20 packets, each containing a tshirt, a poster, and a zine. While all the other components were uniform, none of the zine recipients knew which t-shirt they would receive.</p>

            <![CDATA[<p>The RSS Experiment consists of two parts, each exploring how temporal nature of an RSS feed can be used to visualize alarming statistics about climate change. My raw materials were the type of statistic that makes a great sound byte &mdash; "Every 10 minutes, 10 species of bird nears extinction" &mdash; but are too abstract to really have any lasting impact. </p>

<p>RSS can act as a sort of nervous system of information, allowing its subscribers to monitor an infinite number of situations from the same interface. I explored the idea of giving my raw statistics more weight by exploiting the temporal nature of RSS. Its one thing to be told a species goes extinct every 20 minutes, and quite another to actually see a new element appear in a feed each time that species goes extinct. </p>

<p>The first step of the project was to build a dynamic <a href="http://participatorynetworks.katybeck.com/feed.php">RSS feed</a>, which produces an entry for every increment of time implied by a statistic, producing a flood of reminders over the course of the day.</p>

<p>The second part of the project investigates how a raw data format like RSS might manifest itself in a book form without being rendered by a browser or a feed reader.</p>

<div>
<img src="/project-images/rss-experiment-feedreader.png" />
<p>An example of what the feed looks like in a typical feed reader like NetNewsWire.</p>
</div>

<div>
<img src="/project-images/rss-experiment-book-closeup.png" />
<p>The book introduces readers to the structure of xml, and tries to use typesetting and color coding to give an idea of what each of the elements of a feed do. The timestamp, in particular, is called out in red to emphasize the temporal nature of the statistic.</p>
</div>

<div>

<p>The feed folds out into an accordion book.</p>
