<p>This is a little torso she sculpted in clay.  Isn't it amazing?  When I found it, I confess it kind of took me by surprise, I wouldn't have thought of her doing something so intimate.  It is really a sensitive and accurate depiction of the female form.  It is really lovely.</p>]]>

            <![CDATA[<p>My mom was a huge fan of William Steig, and I grew up surrounded by more of this type of book than regular childrens books.  For those I had to go over to my grandmother's house.  The books I found in my box are the kind of books I remember spending hours examining in minute detail. </p>

<p>The green one I remember especially, not because of the anti-technology moral of the thing but mainly because of the art!  Incredibly graphic and detailed line work throughout every page.  Here are just a couple to give you the idea.</p>

<p>Can you tell what the last one is depicting? It is the island of Manhattan, before they decided to take down all the buildings and let it go back to being nature.  Fabulous.</p>]]>

It is no surprise that she was in her heyday when letter-writing was much more commonplace than it is now. My box contains packet after packet of letters like this one. And this one...</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/47582661@N00/3054293857/" title="letters3 by *jenny b allsorts, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3060/3054293857_a4159f6420_o.jpg" width="500" height="362" alt="letters3" /></a></p>

<p>The interesting thing is how mundane and kind of boring these letters are. I thought I would get drawn into them, and not be able to stop reading, but it was typical for them to be like a phone conversation is nowadays, what you've been up to, the trivial things that occupy your days, who stopped by, etc. But I am envious of those days. I can't remember the last time I wrote an actual letter. It is all email and phone conversations that leave little or not tangible trace. There is something so satisfying about a bundle of letters tied up with a string. Its kind of a shame that practice is passing.</p>]]>

            <![CDATA[<p>I have soooo many memories of trips to the original Disneyland in California. Who knows which trip these tickets came from. My mom loved the Disneyland train, and the goofy guy running it and the funny monologue he delivered as you rode around the park. She repeated lines from it often, thought it was so funny, all the lame puns and so forth. I wouldn't be surprised if that was why she saved these, because they reminded her of that ride and those fun times.</p>]]>

We took my mom and Virginia there for dinner when they visited London and she apparently saved the menu. Man we had fun. I am still amazed that my mom was intrepid enough to pull off a trip over the pond. Talk about <em>waaaay </em>outside her comfort zone. But I'm so glad she did. She and I talked about that trip many many times. She loved to relive every part of it, especially the time when she and Ginny went to see Phantom of the Opera and had to run for blocks because they went to the wrong theater!</p>]]>

            <![CDATA[<p>Like every other box I've poked around in, this box contains many examples of artwork by moi. I'm a bit chagrined to observe that I wasn't anywhere near the amazing art goddess that my mother (and I) thought. Ah, youth. But this one isn't actually too bad, in fact I can see hints of some future work in it, especially the pointy mountains and the elevated vista looking down on hills and houses in a village. When I get back to Dallas I'll drop in something current work that shows what I'm talking about.</p>

<p>This is also is evidence how my name and the spelling of it has varied through the years. At one time or another I've answered to Jenny, Jennie, Jennifer and even Bunnyfur. </p>]]>

<p>My mom collected fans from when she was very young, and kept a lot of them in this tooled leather box. When I found it and opened the lid, I was drawn back to when I was little, and allowed to handle the fans <em>verrrrry</em> gently.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/47582661@N00/3053499987/" title="fanboxopen by *jenny b allsorts, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3017/3053499987_1356d1132d_o.jpg" width="500" height="411" alt="fanboxopen" /></a></p>

<p>I'm not sure what if anything used to be in the small leather frame, it is empty now. But the fans are still bright and colorful. This one is my favorite (for obvious reasons).</p>

<p>My mom's family lived in Corpus Christi during WWII and the Naval Air Base there was very active. I heard lots of stories of parties and social activities, and I'm sure everyone was very conscientious about knowing what any enlisted man's insignia meant.</p>

<p>These are so cool, there is probably some interesting way to use them in a project.</p>]]>

<p>I grew up hearing many stories of sorority life from my mom, and I know I've talked ad nauseum about how much I regret not being able to be in one. She absolutely loved it. I am so glad you got to have that experience.</p>]]>

            <![CDATA[<p>This is a photo of me and my best friend Cynthia from the Corpus Christi Caller Times newspaper. We called ourselves Cyn and Jen and were inseparable from around third grade through junior high, when the Keillors moved to the Virgin Islands. </p>

<p>The photo is when we were both in Aladdin and the Forty Thieves. We were slave girls and did some sort of slave girl dance. We also had to be in a crowd scene and mutter "bread and butter, rhubarb, rhubarb, bread and butter" because that made for good crowd sounds.</p>

<p>Our parents were great friends, and very involved in community theater. I think they were the reason my family got involved at Little Theater Corpus Christi (LTCC), too. Cyn and I did childrens theater classes and shows, and my folks did things like run the box office or tech work. Cyn folks were actors and in many of the adult theater productions. I remember being jealous when LTCC put on Peter Pan, and George Keillor was a pirate, Helen was Tuptim the Indian princess and Cynthia was a little Indian. </p>

<p>She and I were also both obsessed with drawing. We created comic books with only one copy available. I helped her stick glow-in-the-dark stars in her room just like you! I honestly don't think I have ever had another friend that shared so many of my primary passions since Cynthia.</p>]]>

            <![CDATA[<p>A pair of Spanish <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castanets">castanets</a>. I remember these from the drawer-of-miscellany in a spare chest of drawers that sat on the upstairs landing in my grandmother's house. She would scoot a stool up and let me sit and explore the little treasures she had stashed in the top drawer. (this was actually a dangerous spot to be in, since leaning back a bit too far would have sent me falling headfirst over the banister) I really think this is where my love of tiny things originated, as I would spend hours totally absorbed in the bits and bobs that my magpie grandmother had accumulated. I was given a number of these tiny talismans at some point, and I still have horrible memories of the first garage sale I ever held, when a box of them that wasn't supposed to be in the sale was carted off by a jerk who bullied me into selling them despite my protests. *sob*</p>

<p>Ahem... moving on.</p>

<p>I found the castanets wrapped in newspaper from 1973 which is around the time my grandparents moved from Corpus to California. They were probably given to my mom around then. I have a sense that I've heard where they came from to begin with, but I can't recall it. I think somewhere there is a photo of either my mother or my aunt dressed in a Spanish costume, and I recently found a lace mantilla that probably was part of the ensemble. No clue what the occasion might have been. </p>

<p>I remember trying to learn how to play them. Totally unsuccessful. If you'd like to see some awesome castanet playing, check out this cool <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlBM3apqmE0">video</a> on youtube.</p>]]>

            <![CDATA[<p>This is my first post, and this is my box, by a sunny window.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/47582661@N00/3041271577/" title="box2 by *jenny b allsorts, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3159/3041271577_90d767a632_o.jpg" width="500" height="393" alt="box2" /></a></p>

<p>I remember filling this with random things at my mom's place in California, in preparation for her move to Texas.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/47582661@N00/3042113516/" title="nosale by *jenny b allsorts, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3290/3042113516_d57fe042e0_o.jpg" width="500" height="406" alt="nosale" /></a></p>

<p>After she died I went through the dozens of boxes in her storage unit, deciding which things to keep, and which should go in the estate sale. There were lots of boxes I marked "no sale" and took home so I could go through them later. I have explored several boxes so far, but not this one. It is an odd combination of emotions for me to pull things from these boxes, some of which I haven't seen in literally decades. I find things that are amusing, often poignant, and sometimes enigmatic. I expected these old memories to make me sad for the lost times, but I was pleasantly surprised to find enjoyment reliving them. I'm looking forward to seeing what surprises are waiting in here...</p>
