<p>This is a little torso she sculpted in clay.  Isn't it amazing?  When I found it, I confess it kind of took me by surprise, I wouldn't have thought of her doing something so intimate.  It is really a sensitive and accurate depiction of the female form.  It is really lovely.</p>]]>

<p>Anyways, I can remember you and Gramma talking about the PEO when I was in high school. You would never tell me what it was, but you would drop lots of intriguing hints. It was really annoying. :)</p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>My mom was a huge fan of William Steig, and I grew up surrounded by more of this type of book than regular childrens books.  For those I had to go over to my grandmother's house.  The books I found in my box are the kind of books I remember spending hours examining in minute detail. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/47582661@N00/3072609722/" title="book1 by *jenny b allsorts, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3198/3072609722_aa1f8012c7_o.jpg" width="500" height="530" alt="book1" /></a></p>

<p>The green one I remember especially, not because of the anti-technology moral of the thing but mainly because of the art!  Incredibly graphic and detailed line work throughout every page.  Here are just a couple to give you the idea.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/47582661@N00/3071773255/" title="book2 by *jenny b allsorts, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3145/3071773255_7f7bfcaf3f_o.jpg" width="500" height="321" alt="book2" /></a></p>

<p>Can you tell what the last one is depicting? It is the island of Manhattan, before they decided to take down all the buildings and let it go back to being nature.  Fabulous.</p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>It is probably becoming very clear that my mom loved to save every scrap of memorabilia from her life. It is no surprise that she was in her heyday when letter-writing was much more commonplace than it is now. My box contains packet after packet of letters like this one. And this one...</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/47582661@N00/3054293857/" title="letters3 by *jenny b allsorts, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3060/3054293857_a4159f6420_o.jpg" width="500" height="362" alt="letters3" /></a></p>

<p>The interesting thing is how mundane and kind of boring these letters are. I thought I would get drawn into them, and not be able to stop reading, but it was typical for them to be like a phone conversation is nowadays, what you've been up to, the trivial things that occupy your days, who stopped by, etc. But I am envious of those days. I can't remember the last time I wrote an actual letter. It is all email and phone conversations that leave little or not tangible trace. There is something so satisfying about a bundle of letters tied up with a string. Its kind of a shame that practice is passing.</p>]]>

My mom loved the Disneyland train, and the goofy guy running it and the funny monologue he delivered as you rode around the park. She repeated lines from it often, thought it was so funny, all the lame puns and so forth. I wouldn't be surprised if that was why she saved these, because they reminded her of that ride and those fun times.</p>]]>

<p>Its a fascinating document, filled with stories and pictures and brochures from her trip there. I'm guessing that wasn't supposed to be the assignment, though, because her teacher has written "Did you understand the assignment?" on the back:</p>

<p>My assumption is that she didn't like the assignment as given and did exactly what she wanted. Sounds like a few other people I know. :)</p>]]>

We took my mom and Virginia there for dinner when they visited London and she apparently saved the menu. Man we had fun. I am still amazed that my mom was intrepid enough to pull off a trip over the pond. Talk about <em>waaaay </em>outside her comfort zone. But I'm so glad she did. She and I talked about that trip many many times. She loved to relive every part of it, especially the time when she and Ginny went to see Phantom of the Opera and had to run for blocks because they went to the wrong theater!</p>]]>

When I get back to Dallas I'll drop in something current work that shows what I'm talking about.</p>

<p>This is also is evidence how my name and the spelling of it has varied through the years. At one time or another I've answered to Jenny, Jennie, Jennifer and even Bunnyfur. </p>]]>

<p>My mom collected fans from when she was very young, and kept a lot of them in this tooled leather box. When I found it and opened the lid, I was drawn back to when I was little, and allowed to handle the fans <em>verrrrry</em> gently.</p>

<p>I'm not sure what if anything used to be in the small leather frame, it is empty now. But the fans are still bright and colorful. This one is my favorite (for obvious reasons).</p>

<p>And I promise I opened them <em>verrrrry</em> gently.</p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>Let's say it together... awwwwwwwwwwwww! Every box I've gone through has a collection of sweet greeting cards. These must have been sent to me, and saved by my mom. She inherited this trait from my grandmother, and her mother before, who filled scrapbooks with greeting cards. I've saved some, but today's cards don't seem to be as cute or clever as they used to be.</p>]]>
